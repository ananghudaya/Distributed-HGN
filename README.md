# Distributed-HGN

## Introduction

This respository contains java classes for Distributed Hierarchical Graph Neuron (DHGN) implementation for simple pattern recognition application.  

DHGN is an associative memory network that comprises a number of modified Hierarchical Graph Neuron (HGN) subnets and a Stimulator/Interpreter Module (SI Module) node. DHGN has been developed for distributed pattern recognition application, in which the respective recognition procedure can be applied in a distributed manner.

This package is the DHGN Java version of Original GN algorithm by Dr. Asad I. Khan This program accepts multiple-value patterns (up to 10000 patterns tested) with multiple character input element.

## Contents

This repo contains a "DHGN.jar" file for DHGN subnet implementation, together with input and parameter files. This jar file includes the following java classes:
- DHGN.java
- GN.java
- BiasArray.java
